 capstone1 is a Program that can be used to calculate Simple Interest and Compound Interest
 I used stackoverflow to learn about disabling case sensitivity
 I used Youtube for tips https://youtu.be/EtoQ_PqIG5E
 Simple interest calculator: =P*(1+r*t)

 I used the dictionary for definitions https://byjus.com/maths/

The formulae are as follows:
Compound interest calculator: = P* math.pow((1+r),t)
 p = Principal amount(investment amount)
 r = rate(interest rate)
 t = time(period of investment)
 * = raise to the power
